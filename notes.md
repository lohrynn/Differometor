# Candidate Libraries
## PyGAD
- not that great
- Slow because of CPU
## EvoX (maybe also EvoGP, EvoRL)
- Seem great but are torch based
- Older jax-based EvalX version (0.9.0) exists

## evosax
- Seems good
- jax-based
- many algorithms (no PSO seemingly)

## numpyro
- jax-based, relies on jax' autodiff
- For bayesian regression

# Algos to try
