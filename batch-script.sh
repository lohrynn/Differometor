ls $WORK # not necessary just here to illustrate that $WORK is available here


# Setup Phase
# add possibly other setup code here, e.g.
# - copy singularity images or datasets to local on-compute-node storage like /scratch_local
# - loads virtual envs, like with anaconda
# - set environment variables
# - determine commandline arguments for `srun` calls
source $WORK/Differometor/.venv/bin/activate

# Compute Phase
srun python -m optimization.voyager.voyager_evox_pso   # srun will automatically pickup the configuration defined via `#SBATCH` and `sbatch` command line arguments
